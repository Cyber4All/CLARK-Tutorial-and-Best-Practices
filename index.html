				<h2>Tips</h2>
				<h4>Upload your contributions in small self-contained parts</h4>
                <p>CLARK adheres to the following hierarchy for learning objects - Course > Unit > Module > Micro-module > Nano-module. Instead of uploading an entire course into one contribution, it is recommended you upload multiple, smaller sized learning objects. So, if the 'course' has multiple 'modules,' please upload each module separately. Each module should be self-contained, and all modules can be linked to one course in the contributor dashboard.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>It's all in the name!</h4>
                <p>Condense as much as you can with your Learning Object names while keeping the essence of that object is about. This convention makes your object easier to identify during searches.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>

			<a name="Uploading"><div class="section">
				<h2>Uploading a Learning Object</h2>
				<p>To create a new learning object, you must first sign into CLARK. Click on the <i>Contribute</i> button. Then, click the <i>Add New button.</i></p>
				<p>After entering the name of your learning object, you will notice that each object also has a type. Below are the five types an object can have:</p>
				<center><table style="width: 100%; padding: 5px;">
					<tr>
						<th style="width: 20%;">
							<h4>Nanomodule</h4>
							<p>Up to 1 hour</p>
						</th>
						<th style="width: 20%;">
							<h4>Micromodule</h4>
							<p>Between 1 and 4 hours</p>
						</th>
						<th style="width: 20%;">
							<h4>Module</h4>
							<p>Between 4 and 10 hours</p>
						</th>
						<th style="width: 20%;">
							<h4>Unit</h4>
							<p>Over 10 hours</p>
						</th>
						<th style="width: 20%;">
							<h4>Course</h4>
							<p>15 weeks</p>
						</th>
					</tr>
				</table></center>
				<p>An object also has a level which tells a content consumer what academic level your curriculum is intended for.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>
		
			<a name="Descriptions"><div class="section">
				<h2>Adding Descriptions and Other Authors</h2>
				<p>A description should accurately describe what you&#39;re learning object is and briefly state what it hopes to accomplish. This is indexed for searches and shown on search results. Keep in mind that there is a section where you will write out the outcomes for your learning object in greater detail.</p>
				<center>
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Adding-Authors.PNG" width="700px">
				</center>
				<p>In addition, you have the option to add other authors to your learning object if they assisted in developing the curriculum. To do this, simply type in their CLARK username or real name and press enter and their profile should be listed below. From there, select the user that you would like to add as an author. If your collaborators do not have a CLARK account, you can add their name and/or university to the learning object description or notes section.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>

			
			<br><br>
		
			<a name="Outcomes"><div class="section">
				<h2>Adding Learning Outcomes</h2>
				<p>You must add at least one learning outcome to your object to continue in the creation process. Click the <i>Add Learning Outcome</i> button. You will notice there are three categories (based on Bloom's taxonomy) for a learning outcome: <i>Remember and Understand</i>, <i>Apply and Analyze</i>, and <i>Evaluate and Synthesize</i>. Each category represents a level the student should be able to do, <i>Remember and Understand</i> being the simplest (such as introducing a topic) and <i>Evaluate and Synthesize</i> being complex.</p>
				<p>These different categories have different key words. While the simplest will say things like <i>classify</i>, <i>find</i>, or <i>describe</i> the most complex level will say things like <i>compose</i>, <i>debug</i>, or <i>theorize</i>. Choose the level that will most accurately reflect that outcome. You can add as many as your learning object requires. Please note how the outcome will appear outside of the object creation menu. For instance, assume in the first field you chose <i>classify</i> and for the second you wrote <i>different categories of errors</i>. The outcome will generate as:</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Students will be able to classify different categories of errors.</i></p>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Mapping an outcome means that the outcome will linked to standardized outcomes. These standardized outcomes come from various sources such as the CAE Cyber Defense Education KUs or ACM CSEC 2017 outcomes. There are many ways to search for specific outcomes, however be sure that they accurately reflect the outcome it is mapped to. Mapping your outcomes is recommended but are not required.</p>

			<a name="Materials"><div class="section">
				<h2>Uploading New Materials</h2>
				<p>On the left-hand side learning object creation panel there is an option to upload materials. This is where you want to include any specific files, URLs, pictures, etc. necessary to complete your learning object. Note: if you have not verified your email address you will be unable to upload files for your learning object.</p>
				<p>To upload files, you can drag and drop any file into the drop box. Alternatively, you can click the new button to upload individual or multiple files or folders. These files will be tied to this specific learning object. Each file uploaded has a description tag (which is used to describe a file if necessary) and an option to remove the file from the object.</p>
				<p>Under <i>URLS</i> you can provide specific URLs to any videos, online modules, etc. needed to complete the learning object.</p>
				<p>Under <i>Notes</i> you can provide any copyright information or general notes about your files.</p>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Your files should automatically upload. There is no limit to the file sizes you can upload however, please be aware that the larger the file, the longer it will take to upload. Depending on how large the file, the server may timeout the request (these are for files cumulating larger than a few GB). To prevent this, it is advised you upload portions of your object at a time depending on file size. You can upload exercise solution files, but they will be identified and not distributed through CLARK. A content consumer will be provided your email to obtain solutions directly from you.</p>

					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Materials-Upload.png" width="960px">
					<p style="padding-top: 20px;">You have now successfully created your first learning object!</p>
				</center>
			</div>
			<br><br>
		
			<a name="Editing"><div class="section">
				<h2>Editing Learning Objects</h2>
				<p>Go back to your learning objects dashboard. You will notice that the learning object you have just created has appeared in this list.</p>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">To edit a learning object, click the 'meatball menu' (...) of the object you want to edit. There will be a list of different options, including an option to edit the learning object itself and manage the materials in it.</p>
				<center>
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Editing-Options.png" width="960px">
				</center>
				<p style="padding-top: 20px;">From here, click the <i>Edit</i> option and you will be redirected to the learning object creation page. You can edit or change as much as you desire. Do not forget to save your object after you have made your changes.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>

			<a name="Children"><div class="section">
				<h2>Adding Children Learning Objects</h2>
				<p>When you upload a large learning object that uses many smaller objects in it, it is useful to add these objects as <i>children</i> to the larger one.  This is to help organize your larger learning objects and allow downloaders to easily find all the parts of your curriculum.</p>
				<p>To start adding child objects go to your dashboard, click on the meatball menu of the parent object, and click the option that says <i>Edit Children.</i>  From here you have the option to choose which learning objects are the children at that object.  Note that the option to add children is available for all lengths of objects excluding nanomodules.  It is important to only add the direct children of the specific learning object you are working on.</p>
				<center>
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Child-Objects.png" width="960px">
				</center>
				<p>The image above is a good example of what to follow when creating the hierarchy for your learning objects.  You can edit an object&#39;s children at anytime, simply click on the meatball menu and reselect the children learning objects.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>
		
			<a name="Unpublishing"><div class="section">
				<h2>Unpublishing and Viewing Objects in the CUBE</h2>
				<p>If you go back to your learning objects dashboard and click the meatball menu, you will notice a list of options (one of which is <i>Viewing the object in the CUBE</i>). Viewing the object shows you what your object looks to others who want to download it. It will display all the learning outcomes, description, links, files, and notes you inputted in the creation process.</p>
				<p>Going to the same list, there is an option to <i>Unpublish/Publish</i>. Unpublishing means that the object is unavailable for download until you republish it. Note that when you create a new learning object, by default it is unpublished, and you must manually publish it. Once you hit publish, the learning object will be reviewed before it will be available for download.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>
		
			<a name="Deleting"><div class="section">
				<h2>Deleting a Learning Object</h2>
				<p>Go to your learning objects dashboard. From here click on the meatball menu, same as you would if you wanted to edit/publish/unpublish an object. There is an option to delete that individual learning object. The second way is to delete multiple at once. To do this check each learning object you want to delete then click on the delete button at the top of the page.</p>
				<br>
				<center>
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Delete.PNG" width="960px">
				</center>
			</div>
			<br><br>

			<a name="Searching"><div class="section">
				<h2>Searching for Learning Objects</h2>
				<p>From the home page, there are multiple options to search and browse learning objects. From here you can search for specific names, authors, or standard learning outcomes (CAE/CSEC2017/CS2013, etc.). You can filter the results alphabetically, chronologically, and by academic level and length. You can clear your filters if you find you no longer need them.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>

			<a name="Misc"><div class="section">
				<h2>Your Library, Downloading, and Sharing</h2>
				<p>Every object that is published has the option to be added to your library. If you navigate to the detail view of a learning object it will give you a detailed look at what that contains (outcomes, files, descriptions, etc.). When you want to add something to your library, click on the <i>Add to Library</i> button in this view. If you have not already signed in you will be prompted to do so.</p>
				<p>There are many benefits to adding an object to your library, much of which is that if the author updates the learning object you will be notified. If you find you do not like a learning object and wish to remove it from your library, click on the library icon in the navigation bar and delete the ones you wish to remove.</p>
				<p>If the learning object is not undergoing review, you have the option to download the learning object. Click on the <i>Download</i> button to download a zip file of the learning object. The learning object will be automatically added to your library if you have not already done so.</p>
				<center>
					<br><img src="./Resources/CLARK-Download-Library.PNG"><br>
					<p>If you enjoyed a learning object you are encouraged to share a link to it using the share bar.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 12px;">Notice Regarding NSA NCCP Course Materials</p>
		<p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 20px;">These course materials were created under a U.S. Government grant. The terms of the Call for Proposals advised the course creator that the materials would be made "publicly available for educational institutions" to educate and prepare their graduates for potential future employment with the U.S. Government in the cybersecurity field. The terms of the grant further provided that, with respect to any copyright in the materials, the U.S. Government reserved a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so. Strengthening the Nation's cybersecurity, particularly through cybersecurity education at all levels of education to foster the knowledge and skills of individuals who may ultimately join the U.S. Government, is an important Federal purpose. Consistent with the Call for Proposals and the terms of the grant, in making these materials publicly available the U.S. Government authorizes others to reproduce, publish and use them in furtherance of this Federal purpose.</p>
