				<h2>Tips</h2>
				<hr>
				<h4>Upload your contributions in small self-contained parts</h4>
                <p>CLARK adheres to the following hierarchy for learning objects - Course > Unit > Module > Micromodule > Nanomodule. Instead of uploading an entire course into one contribution, it is recommended you upload multiple, smaller sized learning objects. So, if the 'course' has multiple 'modules,' please upload each module separately. Each module should be self-contained, and all modules can be linked to one course in the contributor dashboard.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>It's all in the name!</h4>
                <p>Condense as much as you can with your Learning Object names while keeping the essence of that object is about. This convention makes your object easier to identify during searches.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>

			<a name="Users"><div class="section">
				<h2>Learning Objects Dashboard</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>To access your dashboard, click the drop-down for your name and select <i>Dashboard</i> in the nav bar at the top of the page. You will be redirected to the dashboard page. On this page, you can search and manage your learning objects. Learning objects can be found under either the <i>Draft</i> or <i>Released</i> tabs.</p>
				<div class="picture">
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Dashboard.png" width="1000px">
				</div>
				<p style="padding-top: 20px;">Under the <i>Draft</i> tab, you can create new learning objects, edit unreleased learning objects, and manage learning objects that are waiting for review, under review, in proofing, or denied. You can search by keywords or filter learning objects by status under this tab.</p>
				<div class="picture">
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Dashboard-DraftFilters.png">
				</div>
				<p style="padding-top: 20px;">Under the <i>Released</i> tab, you will be able to view all released learning objects. You can view and manage learning object information such as metrics and create revisions, as well as search your released learning objects.</p>
				<div class="picture">

			<a name="Uploading"><div class="section">
				<h2>Creating a New Learning Object</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Navigate to your dashboard. Under the <i>Draft</i> tab, you can create a new learning object by clicking the <i>NEW +</i> button. If there are no learning objects in your <i>Draft</i> tab, you may also click the <i>CREATE A LEARNING OBJECT +</i> button. The learning object builder will open. You will first need to give your learning object a name in order to be able to add learning outcomes, which at least one is required, and to also be able to upload materials.</p>
				<div class="picture">
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-LO-Builder.png" width="1000px">
				</div>
				<p style="padding-top: 20px;">You will notice that each object requires a length. You will need to specify the length of the learning object you will be uploading. Below are the five lengths an object can have:</p>
				<table class="length">
					<tr>
						<th class="length">
							<h4>Nanomodule</h4>
							<p>Up to 1 hour</p>
						</th>
						<th class="length">
							<h4>Micromodule</h4>
							<p>Between 1 and 4 hours</p>
						</th>
						<th class="length">
							<h4>Module</h4>
							<p>Between 4 and 10 hours</p>
						</th>
						<th class="length">
							<h4>Unit</h4>
							<p>Over 10 hours</p>
						</th>
						<th class="length">
							<h4>Course</h4>
							<p>15 weeks</p>
						</th>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>An object also has a level which tells a content consumer what academic level your curriculum is intended for. For instance, if you are uploading a object that is intended for K-12, then you should specify the academic level here.  There are not limits to the amount of levels a object can have, you could specify the object to be suitible to anyone (K-12 through Postgraduate).</p>
				<p>The description should accurately describe what your learning object is and briefly state what it hopes to accomplish. This is indexed for searches and shown on search results. Keep in mind that there is a section where you will write out the outcomes for your learning object in greater detail. This section is required in order to have your object reviewed and published.</p>
				<p>Please reference the <i>Adding Contributors</i> section of this tutorial to understand how to appropriately attribute your learning object.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>
		
			<a name="Contributors"><div class="section">
				<h2>Adding Contributors</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>It is required to add all contributors to your learning object if they assisted in developing the curriculum. To do this, simply type in their CLARK username or real name and select the user that you would like to add as a contributor. You must include yourself as a contributor if you worked on any of the material in order for the learning object to be attributed correctly. You do not include yourself as a contributor if you are only uploading the learning object. If your collaborators do not have a CLARK account, you can add their name and/or university to the learning object description or notes section. To remove a contributor, hover over their name in the learning object builder and click the <i>Remove</i> button.</p>

			<br><br>
			
			<a name="Outcomes"><div class="section">
				<h2>Adding Learning Outcomes</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>You must add at least one learning outcome to your object to submit your learning object in for review. Click the <i>New</i> button. You will notice there are three categories (based on the Bloom&#39;s taxonomy) for a learning outcome: <i>Remember and Understand</i>, <i>Apply and Analyze</i>, and <i>Evaluate and Synthesize</i>. Each category represents a level the student should be able to do, <i>Remember and Understand</i> being the simplest (such as introducing a topic) and <i>Evaluate and Synthesize</i> being complex.</p>
				<p>These categories have different keywords. While the simplest will say things like <i>classify</i>, <i>find</i>, or <i>describe</i> the most complex level will say things like <i>compose</i>, <i>debug</i>, or <i>theorize</i>. To input your learning outcome, copy and paste it into the input text field. The first word that is in the sentence will be highlighted as the outcome&#39;s keyword. If it is red, this means your keyword is not recognized by the system and you must choose another; this can be done by clicking a level and selecting the word you want via a drop-down menu. Do not include <i>Students will be able to</i> when creating new outcomes.  There is no limit on the amount of outcomes a learning object can have.</p>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Mapping an outcome means that the outcome will linked to standardized outcomes. These standardized outcomes come from various sources such as the CAE Cyber Defense Education KUs or ACM CSEC 2017 outcomes. To map your outcomes, search for the standardized outcome you would like to add. Mapping your outcomes is recommended but is not required.</p>

			<a name="Materials"><div class="section">
				<h2>Uploading New Materials</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>By now, you have named a learning object, set it&#39;s description, and added outcomes to it. If you navigate to the <i>Materials</i> page, this is where you want to include any specific files, URLs, pictures, etc. necessary to complete your learning object. Note: if you have not verified your email address you will be unable to upload files for your learning object.</p>
				<p>To upload files, you can drag and drop your files anywhere on the screen. Alternatively, you can click the <i>New Upload</i> button to upload individual or multiple files or folders. These files will be tied to this specific learning object. Each file uploaded has a description tag (which is used to describe a file if necessary) and an option to remove the file from the object.</p>
				<p>Under <i>URLS</i> you can provide specific URLs to any videos, online modules, etc. needed to complete the learning object.</p>
				<p>Under <i>Notes</i> you can provide any copyright information or general notes about your files.</p>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Your files should automatically upload. There is no limit to the file sizes you can upload however, please be aware that the larger the file, the longer it will take to upload. Depending on how large the file, the server may timeout the request (these are for files cumulating larger than a few GB). To prevent this, it is advised you upload portions of your object at a time depending on file size. You can upload exercise solution files, but they will be identified and not distributed through CLARK. A content consumer will be provided your email to obtain solutions directly from you.</p>

			<a name="Children"><div class="section">
				<h2>Adding Children Learning Objects</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>When you upload a large learning object that uses many smaller objects in it, it is useful to add these objects as <i>children</i> to the larger one.  This is to help organize your larger learning objects and allow others to easily find all the parts of your curriculum.</p>
				<p>To start adding child objects go to the learning object builder, click on the <i>Add/Delete</i> button for Children, and click the option that says <i>Add Child +</i> . From here you have the option to search and choose which learning objects are the children of that parent object.  Note that the option to add children is available for all lengths of objects excluding nanomodules.  It is important to only add the direct children of the specific learning object you are working on. For example, the <i>CLARK Tutorial Learning Object</i> is a micromodule that has two children nanomodules. The <i>CLARK Tutorial Learning Object</i> micromodule could then be the child of a learning object that is either a module or a longer length object.</p>
				<div class="picture">
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Children-Objects.png" width="1000px">
					<p style="padding-top: 20px;">Keep in mind adding children only builds the hierarchy for your learning objects.  You can edit an object&#39;s children at anytime by simply navigating to your dashboard and selecting the learning object you would like to make a revision on from the <i>Released</i> tab.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<br><br>

			<a name="Editing"><div class="section">
				<h2>Editing Learning Objects</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Navigate to your dashboard. By default, you should see your draft learning objects under the <i>Draft</i> tab. You will find all learning objects that you have created that have not yet been released in this list.</p>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">To edit a learning object, click the 'meatball menu' (...) of the object you want to edit. There will be a list of different options, including an option to edit the learning object itself and manage the materials in it. From here, click the <i>Edit</i> option and you will be redirected to the learning object creation page. While making changes in the learning object builder, your work will save automatically, similarly to Google Documents. This means you may also leave and return to work on edits at a later time.</p>
				<div class="picture">
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Draft-Edit.png" width="1000px">
					<p style="padding-top: 20px;">Note: you can only edit a learning object that is in an unreleased state. You will not have the option to edit learning objects that are waiting for review, under review, in proofing, or denied.</p>

			<br><br>

			<a name="Revisions"><div class="section">
				<h2>Revising Released Learning Objects</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Navigate to your dashboard and select the <i>Released</i> tab. Click the 'meatball menu' (...) of the object you want to revise and select the <i>info</i> option.</p> 
				<div class="picture">
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-editing-partone.png" width="1000px">
				</div>
				<p style="padding-top: 40px;">A side panal will appear as show in the image below. Under the Revision section, click the <i>Create Revision</i> button. Once the revision is created, click the meatball menu in the Revision section. Click the option to edit the learning object. You will be redirected to the learning object creation page.</p>
				<div class="picture">

				<p style="padding-top: 40px;">While making changes in the learning object builder, your work will save automatically, similarly to Google Documents. This means you may also leave and return to work on revisisons at a later time. Once you are finished with making revisions, click the <i>Submit for Review</i> button. You can submit your revisions for review by either selecting the <i>Submit for Review</i> from the Revisions meatball menu while on the info panal or while in the learning object builder itself. You will need to provide a description of what changes were made in the dialog prompt. Your learning object will need to be approved before it can be released with the revisions you made.</p> 
			</div>
			<br><br>
		
			<a name="Unpublishing"><div class="section">
				<h2>Submitting for Review</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Prior to submitting a learning object for review, thoroughly check your learning object for spelling and grammatical errors, ensure all materials needed for the learning object are uploaded and are accessible, and all learning outcomes are defined. You will need to acknowledge the prompt on the screen that you have self reviewed your learning object prior to review submission.</p>
				<div class="picture">
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Submission-Review.png" width="500px">
				</div>
				<p>Submitting for review means that the learning object will undergo a review process for a given collection that you want to submit to. The reviewing team for that collection will review your object and make a decision to reject or pass it given their criterion. The object is then sent to the CLARK editorial team for proofing. Note that when you create a new learning object, by default it is unreleased, and you must submit it for review in order for other&#39;s download it. Note: when you submit a object for review, you are submitting it under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode">Creative Commons License.</a></p>

			<a name="Deleting"><div class="section">
				<h2>Deleting a Learning Object</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Go to your learning objects dashboard. From here click on the meatball menu, same as you would if you wanted to edit or submit an object for review. There are two options to delete a learning object that you have created. There is an option to delete that individual learning object. The second way is to delete multiple at once. To do this check each learning object you want to delete then click on the delete button at the top of the list.</p>

			<a name="Searching"><div class="section">
				<h2>Searching for Learning Objects</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>From the home page, there are multiple options to search and browse learning objects. From here you can search for specific names, authors, or standard learning outcomes (CAE/CSEC2017/CS2013, etc.). You can filter the results alphabetically, chronologically, and by academic level and length. You can clear your filters if you find you no longer need them.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>

			<a name="Metrics"><div class="section">
				<h2>Learning Objects Metrics</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Naviage to your dashboard and select the <i>Released</i> tab. Click the 'meatball menu' (...) of the object you want to view metrics on and select the <i>info</i> option. A side panel will display showing information about your learing object. Under the <i>Metrics</i> section, you will be able to view the number of times your learning object has been downloaded and the average rating of your learning object. The average rating is composed by reviews left by CLARK users that have used your learning object. </p>

			<a name="Misc"><div class="section">
				<h2>Your Library, Downloading, and Sharing</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Every object that is published has the option to be added to your library. If you navigate to the detail view of a learning object it will give you a detailed look at what that contains (outcomes, files, descriptions, etc.). When you want to add something to your library, click on the <i>Add to Library</i> button in this view. If you have not already signed in you will be prompted to do so.</p>
				<p>There are many benefits to adding an object to your library, one of which is to keep curiculum you found useful in a place that is easily accessable. If you find you do not like a learning object and wish to remove it from your library, click on the library icon in the navigation bar and delete the ones you wish to remove.</p>
				<p>If the learning object is not undergoing review by a specific collection, you have the option to download the learning object. Click on the <i>Download</i> button to download a zip file of the learning object. The learning object will be automatically added to your library if you have not already done so.</p>
				<div class="picture">
