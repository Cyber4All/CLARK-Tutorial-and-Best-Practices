				<h2>Tips</h2>
				<h4>Breaking Down Large Learning Objects</h4>
                <p>Instead of uploading an entire course into one learning object, it is recommended you make multiple, smaller sized learning objects.  This is to encourage granularity in all parts of your object.</p>
                <p>Opposingly, you should not upload a new learning object if it does not have adequate course materials.  For instance, you should not create a new learning object that is only meant to hold one jpg file with no intent for updating the materials.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Learning Objects with Multiple Parts</h4>
                <p>Depending on how many learning objects a unit or larger object has, it can be very confusing to find all the parts in a logical order.  For convience, it is best to name objects as such:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>Higher Priority Learning Object Name</i> [<i># #</i>] - <i>This Learning Object Name</i></p>
                <p>For instance:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>IoT [01] - Introduction</i></p>
                <p>If your smaller object has even more sub objects within it, use this convention: </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>Higher Priority Learning Object Name</i> [<i># #</i> - <i># #</i>] - <i>This Learning Object Name</i></p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>IoT [04-02] - Raspberry Pi 3 Setup</i></p>
                <p>Condense as much as you can with your Learning Object names while still keeping the essence of that object is about.  This convention makes your object easier to identify during searches.</p>

				<h2>Uploading a Learning Object</h2>
				<p>To create a new learning object you must first sign into CLARK. Click on the <i>Contribute</i> button. Then, click the <i>Add New</i> button.</p>
				<p>After entering the name of your learning object, you will notice that each object also has a type.  A learning object type tells a downloader of your object how long to expect to complete your curriculum.  Below are the five types an object can have:</p>
				<center><table style="width: 100%; padding: 5px;">
					<tr>
						<th style="width: 20%;">
							<h4>Nanomodule</h4>
							<p>Up to 1 hour</p>
						</th>
						<th style="width: 20%;">
							<h4>Micromodule</h4>
							<p>Between 1 and 4 hours</p>
						</th>
						<th style="width: 20%;">
							<h4>Module</h4>
							<p>Between 4 and 10 hours</p>
						</th>
						<th style="width: 20%;">
							<h4>Unit</h4>
							<p>Over 10 hours</p>
						</th>
						<th style="width: 20%;">
							<h4>Course</h4>
							<p>15 weeks</p>
						</th>
					</tr>
				</table></center>
				<p>An object also has a level which tells a downloader what academic level your curriculum is intended for.</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h2>Adding Descriptions and Other Authors</h2>
				<p>A description should accurately describe what your learning object is and briefly state what it hopes to accomplish.  Keep in mind that there is a section where you will write out the outcomes for your learning object in greater detail.</p>
				<center>
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Adding-Authors.PNG" width="700px">
				</center>
				<p>In addition, you have the option to add other authors to your learning object if they assisted in developing the curriculum.  To do this, simply type in their CLARK username or real name and press enter and their profile should be listed below.  From there, select the user that you would like to add as an author.  If your collaborators do not have a CLARK account, you can add their name and/or university to the learning object description or notes section.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>Adding Learning Outcomes</h2>
				<p>You must add at least one learning outcome to your object in order to continue in the creation process.  Click the <i>Add Learning Outcome</i> button.  You will notice there are three categories for a learning outcome: <i>Remember and Understand</i>, <i>Apply and Analyze</i>, and <i>Evaluate and Synthesize</i>.  Each category represents a level the student should be able to do, <i>Remember and Understand</i> being the simplest (such as introducing a topic) and <i>Evaluate and Synthesize</i> being complex.</p>
				<p>These different categories have different key words.  While the simplest will say things like <i>classify</i>, <i>find</i>, or <i>describe</i> the most complex level will say things like <i>compose</i>, <i>debug</i>, or <i>theorize</i>.  Choose the level that will most accurately reflect that outcome.  You can add as many as your learning object requires.  Please note how the outcome will appear outside of the object creation menu.  For instance, assume in the first field you chose <i>classify</i> and for the second you wrote <i>different catagories of errors.</i>  The outcome will generate as:</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Students will be able to classify different catagories of errors.</i></p>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Mapping an outcome means that the outcome will linked to standardized outcomes.  These standardized outcomes come from various sources such as the CAE Cyber Defense or NCWF.  There are many ways to search for specific outcomes, however be sure that they accurately reflect the outcome it is mapped to.  Mapping your outcomes are recommended but are not required.</p>

				<h2>Uploading New Materials</h2>
				<p>On the left hand side learning object creation panel there is an option to upoad materials.  This is where you want to include any specific files, urls, pictures, etc. necessary to complete your learning object.  Note: if you have not verified your email adress you will be unable to upload files for your learning object.</p>
				<p>To upload files you can drag and drop any file into the drop box.  Alternatively, you can click the new button to upload individual or multiple files or folders.  These files will be tied to this specific learning object.  Each file uploaded has a description tag (which is used to describe a file if necessary) and an option to remove the file from the object.</p>
				<p>Under <i>URLS</i> you can provide specific URLs to any videos, online modules, etc. needed to complete the learning object.</p>
				<p>Under <i>Notes</i> you can provide any copyright information or general notes about your files.</p>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Your files should automatically upload.  There is no limit to the file sizes you can upload however, please be aware that the larger the file, the longer it will take to upload.  Depending on how large the file, the server may timeout the request (these are for files cumulating larger then a few GB).  To prevent this, it is advised you upload portions of your object at a time depending on file size.</p>
				<center>
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Materials-Upload.png" width="700px">
					<p style="padding-top: 20px;">You have now successfully created your first learning object!</p>
				</center>
			</div>
			<br><br>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>Editing Learning Objects</h2>
				<p>Go back to your learning objects dashboard.  You will notice that the learning object you have just created has appeared in this list.</p>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">To edit a learning object, click the right side (the side with three dots) of the object you want to edit.  There will be a list of different options, including an option to edit the learning object itself and manage the materials in it.</p>
				<center>
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Editing-Options.png" width="960px">
				</center>
				<p style="padding-top: 20px;">From here, click the edit button and you will be redirected to the learning object creation page.  You can edit or change as much as you desire.  Do not forget to save your object after you have made your changes.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>Unpublishing and Viewing Objects in the CUBE</h2>
				<p>If you go back to your learning objects dashboard and click the three dots of a learning object, you will notice a list of options (one of which is <i>Viewing the object in the CUBE</i>).  Viewing the object shows you what your object looks to others who want to download it.  It will display all of the learning outcomes, description, links, files, and notes you inputed in the creation process.</p>
				<p>Going to the same list, there is an option to <i>Unpublish/Publish</i>.  Unpublishing means that the object is unavialable for download until you republish it.  Note that when you create a new learning object, by default it is unpublished and you must manually publish it.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>Deleting a Learning Object</h2>
				<p>Go to your learning objects dashboard.  From here click on the three dots, same as you would if you wanted to edit/publish/unpublish an object.  There is an option to delete that individual learning object.  The second way is to delete multiple at once.  To do this check each learning object you want to delete then click on the delete button at the top of the page.</p>
				<br>
				<center>
					<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Delete.PNG" width="960px">

			</div>
			<br><br>

			<div class="section">
				<h2>Searching for Learning Objects</h2>
				<p>From the home page, there are multiple options to browse learning objects.  Clicking on any of these will take you to the browsing site of CLARK.  From here you can search for specific names, authors, or outcomes.  You can filter the results alphabetically, chronologically, and by academic level and length.  You can clear your filters if you find you no longer need them.</p>
			</div>
			<br><br>

			<div class="section">
				<h2>Your Library, Downloading, and Sharing</h2>
				<p>Every object that is published has the option to be added to your library.  If you navigate to the CUBE version of a learning object it will give you a detailed look at what that contains (outcomes, files, descriptions, etc.).  When you want to add something to your library, click on the <i>Add to Library</i> button in this view.  If you have not already signed in you will be prompted to do so.</p>
				<p>There are many benefits to adding an object to your library, much of which is that if the author updates the learning object you will be notified.  If you find you do not like a particular learning object and wish to remove it from your library, click on the library icon in the navigation bar and delete the ones you wish to remove.</p>
				<p>If the learning object is not undergoing review, you have the option to download the learning object.  Click on the <i>Download</i> button to download a zip file of the learning object.  The learning object will be automatically added to your library if you have not already done so.</p>
				<center>
					<br><img src="./Resources/CLARK-Download-Library.PNG"><br>
				</center>
				<p>If you thoroughly enjoyed a particular learning object you are encouraged to share it on various social media websites.</p>
