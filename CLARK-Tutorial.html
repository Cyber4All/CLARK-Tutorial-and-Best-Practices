			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>Lets make a new learning object:</p>
			<p>First, sign into CLARK. Click on the "Contribute" button. Then, click the "Add New" button</p>
			<p>A learning object is a object that holds all of the module, unit, or course information a person needs to complete your learning object.  It also gives another person an idea what your learning object is about and what it will accomplish.</p>
			<p>After entering the name of your learning object, you might notice that each object also has a “type.”  A learning object “type” tells another person how long to expect to complete the object.  An object also has a level which tells a person who your object is meant for.  Each learning object also has a level which is used to tell another person what academic level the learning object is for.</p>

			<h2>Adding Descriptions and Other Authors</h2>
			<p>A description should accurately describe what your learning object is.  It can describe what it hopes to teach however, keep in mind that there is a section where you will write out the outcomes for your learning object. You may also write grant and other copyright information in this field</p>
			<center>
				<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Adding-Authors.PNG" width="700px">
			</center>
			<p>In addition, you have the option to add other authors to your learning object.  To do this, simply type in their CLARK username and press enter.  Their profile should be an option below; from here you click on the username that you would like to add as an author.  You can add their name and/or university to the learning object description if they do not have a CLARK account.</p>
		</div>
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="section">
			<h2>Adding Learning Outcomes</h2>
			<p>You must add at least one learning outcome to your object in order to continue making your object.  Click the “Add Learning Outcome” button.  You will notice there are three categories for a learning outcome: “Remember and Understand”, “Apply and Analyze”, and “Evaluate and Synthesize”.  Each category represents a level the student should be able to do, “Remember and Understand” being the simplest (such as introducing a topic) and “Evaluate and Synthesize” being complex.</p>
			<p>Different categories have different key words too.  While the simplest will say things like “classify”, “find”, or “describe” the most complex level will say things like “compose”, “debug”, or “theorize”.  Choose the level that will most accurately reflect that outcome, you can always add more!</p>
			<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Mapping an outcome means that it can be linked to standardized outcomes from various sources such as the CAE Cyber Defense or NCWF.  There are various ways to search for specific outcomes, however be sure that they accurately reflect the outcome it is mapped to.  Mapping your outcomes are recommended but are not required.</p>

			<h2>Uploading New Materials</h2>
			<p>On the left hand side learning object creation panel there is an option to upoad materials.  This is where you want to include any specific files, urls, pictures, etc. necessary to complete your learning object.  Note: if you have not verified your email adress you will be unable to upload files for your learning object.</p>
			<p>To upload files you can drag and drop any file into the file drop box.  Alternatively, you can click the new button to upload individual or multiple files or folders.  These files will be tied to this specific learning object.  Each file uploaded has a description tag (which is used to describe a file if necessary) and an option to remove the file from the object.</p>
			<p>Under “URLS” you can provide specific URLs to any videos, online modules, etc. needed to complete the learning object.</p>
			<p>Under “Notes” you can provide any copyright information or any general notes about your files.</p>
			<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Your files should automatically upload.  There is no limit to the file sizes you can upload however, please be aware that the larger the file, the longer it will take to upload.  Depending on how large the file, the server may timeout the request (these are for files cumulating larger then a few GB).  To prevent this, it is advised you upload portions of your object at a time.</p>

				<p style="padding-top: 20px;">You have now successfully created your first learning object!</p>
			</center>
		</div>
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="section">
			<h2>Editing Learning Objects</h2>
			<p>Go back to your learning objects list.  You will notice that the learning object you have just created has appeared in this list.  Lets say in the object you just created there is an error and you need to fix it.  How do you do this?</p>
			<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">All you have to do is click the right side of the learning object that has three dots.  There are many different options, including an option to edit the learning object itself and manage it’s materials.</p>
			<center>
				<img src="./Resources/CLARK-Editing-Options.png" width="960px">
			</center>
			<p style="padding-top: 20px;">From there, clicking the editing button will take you back to the same page used to originally create your object.  You can edit or change as much as you desire.</p>
		</div>
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="section">
			<h2>Unpublishing and Viewing Objects in the CUBE</h2>
			<p>Viewing the object in the CUBE shows you what your object looks to others who want to download it.  It will show you all of the learning outcomes you put in, the description, links, files, and notes.</p>
			<p>Unpublishing means that the object is unavialable for download until you republish it.</p>
		</div>
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="section">
			<h2>Deleting a Learning Object</h2>
			<p>Of course we don't want you to delete your objects however, if you must there are two ways to delete a learning object.  Go to the "Contribute" tab to look at all of your objects.  From here click on the three dots, same as you would if you wanted to edit an object.  There is an option to delete that particular learning object.  The second way is to delete multiple at once.  To do this check each learning object you want to delete then click on the delete button at the top of the page.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 12px;">Notice Regarding NSA NCCP Course Materials</p>
		<p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 20px;">These course materials were created under a U.S. Government grant. The terms of the Call for Proposals advised the course creator that the materials would be made "publicly available for educational institutions" to educate and prepare their graduates for potential future employment with the U.S. Government in the cybersecurity field. The terms of the grant further provided that, with respect to any copyright in the materials, the U.S. Government reserved a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so. Strengthening the Nation's cybersecurity, particularly through cybersecurity education at all levels of education to foster the knowledge and skills of individuals who may ultimately join the U.S. Government, is an important Federal purpose. Consistent with the Call for Proposals and the terms of the grant, in making these materials publicly available the U.S. Government authorizes others to reproduce, publish and use them in furtherance of this Federal purpose.</p>
