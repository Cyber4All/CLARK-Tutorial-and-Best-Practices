		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		<p>Lets make a new learning object:</p>
		<p>First, sign into CLARK. Click on the "Contribute" button. Then, click the "Add New" button</p>
		<p>A learning object is a object that holds all of the module, unit, or course information a person needs to complete your learning object.  It also gives another person an idea what your learning object is about and what it will accomplish.</p>
		<p>After entering the name of your learning object, you might notice that each object also has a “type.”  A learning object “type” tells another person how long to expect to complete the object.  An object also has a level which tells a person who your object is meant for.  Each learning object also has a level which is used to tell another person what academic level the learning object is for.</p>

		<h2>Adding a Description</h2>
		<p>A description should accurately describe what your learning object is.  It can describe what it hopes to teach however, keep in mind that there is a section where you will write out the outcomes for your learning object.</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Adding Learning Outcomes</h2>
		<p>Click the “Add Learning Outcome” button.  You will notice there are three categories for a learning outcome: “Remember and Understand”, “Apply and Analyze”, and “Evaluate and Synthesize”.  Each category represents a level the student should be able to do, “Remember and Understand” being the simplest (such as introducing a topic) and “Evaluate and Synthesize” being complex.</p>
		<p>Different categories have different key words too.  While the simplest will say things like “classify”, “find”, or “describe” the most complex level will say things like “compose”, “debug”, or “theorize”.  Choose the level that will most accurately reflect that outcome, you can always add more!</p>
		<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Mapping an outcome means that it can be linked to standardized outcomes from various sources such as the CAE Cyber Defense or NCWF.  There are various ways to search for specific outcomes, however be sure that they accurately reflect the outcome it is mapped to.</p>

		<h2>Uploading New Materials</h2>
		<p>At the very bottom of the page click on the “Upload Materials” button.  The CUBE will not let you continue to the materials page if you have not inputted the required fields for a learning object (ie the name, type, and education level).</p>
		<p>You can drag and drop any file onto this part of the CUBE.  It will be tied to that specific learning object.  This is where you want to include any specific files, urls, pictures, etc. necessary to complete your learning object.  Each file uploaded has a description and an option to remove the file from the object.</p>
		<p>Under “URLS” you can provide specific URLs to any videos, online modules, etc. needed to complete the learning object.</p>
		<p>Under “Notes” you can provide any copyright information or any general notes about your files.</p>
		<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Remember to click “Upload” at the bottom of the page or else the files you want to upload will not be uploaded.</p>
		<center><img src="./Resources/CLARK-Materials-Upload.png">
		<p style="padding-top: 20px;">You have now successfully created your first learning object!</p></center>
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Editing Learning Objects</h2>
		<p>Go back to your learning objects list.  You will notice that the learning object you have just created has appeared in this list.  Lets say in the object you just created there is an error and you need to fix it.  How do you do this?</p>
		<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">All you have to do is click the right side of the learning object that has three dots.  There are many different options, including an option to edit the learning object itself and manage it’s materials.</p>
		<center><img src="./Resources/CLARK-Editing-Options.png" width="960px"></center>
		<p style="padding-top: 20px;">From there, clicking the editing button will take you back to the same page used to originally create your object.  You can edit or change as much as you desire.</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Unpublishing and Viewing Object in the CUBE</h2>
		<p>Viewing the object in the cube shows you what your object looks to others who want to download it.  It will show you all of the learning outcomes you put in, the description, links, files, and notes.</p>
		<p>Unpublishing means that the object is unavialable for download until you republish it.</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Deleting a Learning Object</h2>
		<p>There are two ways to delete a learning object.  Go to the "Contribute" tab to look at all of your objects.  From here click on the three dots, same as you would if you wanted to edit an object.  There is an option to delete that particular learning object.  The second way is to delete multiple at once.  To do this check each learning object you want to delete then click on the delete button at the top of the page.</p>
