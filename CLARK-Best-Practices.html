                <h2>Breaking Down Large Learning Objects</h2>
                <p>Instead of uploading an entire course into one learning object, it is recommended you make multiple, smaller sized learning objects.  This is to encourage granularity in all parts of your object.</p>
                <p>Opposingly, you should not upload a new learning object if it does not have adequate course materials.  For instance, you should not create a new learning object that is only meant to hold one jpg file with no intent for updating the materials.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Learning Objects with Multiple Parts</h2>
                <p>Depending on how many learning objects a unit or larger object has, it can be very confusing to find all the parts in a logical order.  For convience, it is best to name objects as such:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>Higher Priority Learning Object Name</i> [<i># #</i>] - <i>This Learning Object Name</i></p>
                <p>For instance:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>IoT [01] - Introduction</i></p>
                <p>If your smaller object has even more sub objects within it, use this convention: </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>Higher Priority Learning Object Name</i> [<i># #</i> - <i># #</i>] - <i>This Learning Object Name</i></p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>IoT [04-02] - Raspberry Pi 3 Setup</i></p>
                <p>Condense as much as you can with your Learning Object names while still keeping the essence of that object is about.  This convention makes your object easier to identify during searches.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 20px;">These course materials were created under a U.S. Government grant. The terms of the Call for Proposals advised the course creator that the materials would be made "publicly available for educational institutions" to educate and prepare their graduates for potential future employment with the U.S. Government in the cybersecurity field. The terms of the grant further provided that, with respect to any copyright in the materials, the U.S. Government reserved a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so. Strengthening the Nation's cybersecurity, particularly through cybersecurity education at all levels of education to foster the knowledge and skills of individuals who may ultimately join the U.S. Government, is an important Federal purpose. Consistent with the Call for Proposals and the terms of the grant, in making these materials publicly available the U.S. Government authorizes others to reproduce, publish and use them in furtherance of this Federal purpose.</p>
